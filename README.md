# Boat-type-classification-using-Image-recoginition
The dataset contains 1162 images of 9 boat types. The project involves building two CNN models for classification. The first model uses standard CNN layers with data normalization, while the second employs transfer learning with MobileNetV2. Both models are trained, evaluated, and compared based on performance metrics and test results.
